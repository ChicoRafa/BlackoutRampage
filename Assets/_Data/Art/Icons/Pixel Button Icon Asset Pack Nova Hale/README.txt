GameCube eat your heart out.  You were the worst controller ever made.

Included with the spritesheet is the original layered image I worked with
to create everything in this pack, in it's original .pdn format.

To view a .pdn file, donwload Paint.net (from https://www.getpaint.net)
and use that.  There's plugins that allow it to open .psd files too.  I prefer
Paint.net over Aesprite and Photoshop when I'm working with pixelart.
It's lightweight and has plenty of options, especially with all the addons.
